      "source": "# Introduction\nFor my very first data science project, I would like to understand how data science can be used to better understand the environmental challenges singapore faces today as a nation. I choose to look at factors that affect air pollution as Singapore needs to take more steps to ensure that we [are able to meet air quality targets](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-not-meeting-its-air-quality-targets-masagos-7543240) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). By identifying the root causes for problems, it would help the administrators develop targeted policies to directly address these issues.\n\nAccording to the [National Environment Agency](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/pollution-control/air-pollution/air-quality) (NEA), Singapore enjoys better air quality than many cities in Asia, comparable with that of cities in the United States and Europe. Singapore’s Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) has remained in the ‘Good’ and 'Moderate' range for much of 2017.\n\nThe main sources of air pollution in Singapore are emissions from the industries and motor vehicles. Therefore, we will not only look at the vehicle population data and manufacturing industries data but we will also see if there is a relation between commercial and residential development and air pollution. I choose to include the latter as I feel that Singapore constantly has on-going construction project and i would like to understand if this affects the environment. "

      "source": "## Background\n[Air pollution](https://www.environmentalpollutioncenters.org/air/) can be defined as the presence of toxic chemicals or compounds (including those of biological origin) in the air, at levels that pose a health risk. In an even broader sense, air pollution means the presence of chemicals or compounds in the air which are usually not present and which lower the quality of the air or cause detrimental changes to the quality of life (such as the damaging of the ozone layer or causing global warming).\n\nAir pollution is probably one of the most serious environmental problems confronting our civilization today. Most often, it is caused by human activities such as mining, construction, transportation, industrial work, agriculture, smelting, etc. However, natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and wildfires may also pollute the air, but their occurrence is rare and they usually have a local effect, unlike human activities that are ubiquitous causes of air pollution and contribute to the global pollution of the air every single day.\n\nThe air pollutants that we will be studying in this project are as follows:\n* Sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) : This contaminant is mainly emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels such as crude oil and coal.\n* Carbon monoxide ( CO ) : This gas consists during incomplete combustion of fuels example : A car engine running in a closed room.\n* Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) : These contaminants are emitted by traffic, combustion installations and the industries.\n* Ozone ( O3 ) : Ozone is created through the influence of ultra violet sunlight (UV) on pollutants in the outside air.\n* Particulate Matter ( PM ) : Particulate matter is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air. NEA uses two measurements: PM-10 (10 micrometers or less) and PM-2.5 (2.5 micrometers or less). This complex mixture includes both organic and inorganic particles, such as dust, pollen, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These particles vary greatly in size, composition, and origin."

A description of the pollutants can be found [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/pollution-control/air-pollution/air-quality). Please note that all the data used here can be found at the end of this document.\n\nThe hypotheses that I am trying to test are as follows: \n1.  An increase in the rate of manufacturing would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n2. An increase in the rate of development of commercial and housing development would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n3. An increase in vehicle population would lead to an increase in pollution in Singapore\n\nIn addition, I would also like to identify which pollutant do these industries largely contribute to. "

      "source": "## Results analysis\nThe analysis flow can be summarised into four main steps. They are as follows:\n\nFirst, we will download and import the data. As mentioned previously, the download links for the data used can be found at the end of this document. All downloaded data are in the form of a CSV file.\n\nSecond, we will perform data cleansing. In this step, the first thing I did was to remove all NaN or 0 values and select a timeframe to study. Then I will perform [mean normalization](https://medium.com/greyatom/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e) on the data to get a more accurate statistical analysis and graphical plot. We have to normalize our data because our features do not have a uniform scale. Since I wanted data that was centered at zero and kept within a small range, mean normalization was the most appropriate normalization technique. \n\nThirdly, I want to statistically analyze the data. [DataFrame.corr](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) computes pairwise correlation of columns. The default method used is [spearmans](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/spearmans-rank-order-correlation-statistical-guide.php) to compute the correlation coefficient. \n\nSpearman's correlation determines the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between your two variables rather than the strength and direction of the linear relationship between your two variables, which is what Pearson's correlation determines. A monotonic relationship is a relationship that does one of the following: (1) as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable; or (2) as the value of one variable increases, the other variable value decreases. Since we are trying to understand the trend, spearman would be the most suitable method of compute the correlation coefficient.\n\nNext, I will plot the data on a graph to verify the results obtained in the third step.\n\nFinally, I will conclude with a short write up about the findings."

For this section, I will only be looking at the under construction data for HDB, Emporiums and Supermarkets and Shops, Lock-Up Shops and Eating Houses. The reason why I choose HDB for housing is because 80% of Singaporeans live in HDBs. For commercial development, I chose to study Emporiums and Supermarkets and Shops, Lock-Up Shops and Eating Houses. This is because these two categories are the most commonly developed commercial developments in Singapore. In addition, these are the only two categories that has all the data for the selected time period.\n\nFirst, for the HDB development dataset, we select the data from 2008 to 2014. Then, we need to remove DBSS flats in the type column as we are only looking at HDBs. Then, we need to select 'under construction' in the status column as pollution is mainly produced during construction. Then we need to convert the data in the 'no_of_units' column from string to integer. Finally, we will perform a mean normalization."

Note that nitrogen dioxide is a form of nitrogen oxide. In addition, [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ozone-pollution-grows-but-it-can-be-fixed/) website on the Scientific American says that, there is a correlation between nitrogen oxide levels and ground-level ozone levels. nitrogen oxide pollution, combined with volatile organic compounds, interact in the presence of sunlight to produce ground-level ozone pollution. Since Singapore is a tropical island, we get a lot of sunlight which could explain the high ozone levels.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is **sufficient** evidence to support my third hypothesis."

It has also given us some insight about pollution released by the residencial and commercial development in Singapore and the vehicle population in Singapore. \n\nThankfully, Singapore aims to become a [car-lite socitey](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/getting-singaporeans-embrace-car-lite-society) by 2040. This means that the vehicle population will be significatly reduced.
